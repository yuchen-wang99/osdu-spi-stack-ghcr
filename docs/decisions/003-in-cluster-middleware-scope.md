# ADR-003: In-Cluster Middleware Scope

**Status**: Accepted

## Context

ADR-001 moved every data service with a managed Azure equivalent out of the cluster. Three middleware components have no clean managed drop-in for OSDU's upstream service code:

- **Elasticsearch.** OSDU search and indexer services call the Elasticsearch REST API directly. Azure AI Search is not API-compatible.
- **Redis.** OSDU services require custom CA TLS and specific database isolation (db 1 through 6). Azure Cache for Redis is reachable but adds network latency and cost for what is effectively a cache.
- **PostgreSQL (for Airflow only).** Airflow's scheduler and workers need low-latency access to their metadata database; a single-database workload is an expensive fit for Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

Airflow itself is in-cluster because it orchestrates ingestion workflows that call the in-cluster OSDU APIs.

## Decision

Run exactly three stateful middleware systems in the `platform` namespace, each under a Kubernetes operator:

| Middleware | Operator | Sizing |
|---|---|---|
| Elasticsearch | ECK | 3 nodes, 128 GiB each |
| Redis (TLS) | Bitnami chart + cert-manager | 1 master + 2 replicas, 8 GiB each |
| PostgreSQL (Airflow metadata) | CloudNativePG | 3 instances, 10 GiB + 4 GiB WAL |

Airflow is a non-stateful middleware tenant of this namespace (webserver, scheduler, triggerer).

Rejected:
- Azure Cache for Redis, Azure Database for PostgreSQL: extra latency and cost for workloads that benefit from co-location.
- Azure AI Search: not a drop-in for the Elasticsearch APIs OSDU uses.

## Consequences

- Three stateful workloads still require in-cluster Premium SSD storage (~420 GiB provisioned in total).
- The CA chains for Elasticsearch HTTP and Redis TLS are self-signed (cert-manager + ECK) and must reach the `osdu` namespace; ADR-011 covers the distribution mechanism.
- Operator updates (ECK, CNPG) move with their Flux HelmReleases and land through the normal reconcile loop.
- Backup and disaster recovery for these systems are out of scope for the SPI Stack's dev/test framing; durable state lives in the Azure PaaS resources covered by ADR-001.
