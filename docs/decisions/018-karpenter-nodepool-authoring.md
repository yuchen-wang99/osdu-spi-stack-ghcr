# ADR-018: Karpenter NodePool Authoring as Workload Manifests

**Status**: Accepted

## Context

AKS Automatic ships Karpenter (Node Auto-Provisioning) and disables the classic AKS agent-pool model. Compute capacity is declared via `karpenter.sh/v1.NodePool` and `karpenter.azure.com/v1beta1.AKSNodeClass` Custom Resources. Authoring those CRs is a placement decision: they could live in Bicep alongside the cluster (`infra/aks.bicep`), be applied imperatively by the CLI during bootstrap, or live as workload manifests under `software/` and reconcile through Flux like everything else in the cluster.

The placement choice matters because the same CRs need to evolve with workload shape: SPI Stack runs platform middleware (ECK, CNPG, Redis, Airflow) on one taint domain and OSDU services on another, so the NodePools change when the workload mix changes — not when the cluster shape changes.

## Decision

Author Karpenter `NodePool` and `AKSNodeClass` resources as Flux-managed workload manifests in `software/components/nodepools/`, reconciled by the `spi-nodepools` Kustomization at Layer 0b of the core profile (after `spi-namespaces`, before any layer that schedules workloads).

Two NodePools today:

- `platform` — taint `workload=platform:NoSchedule`, requirements `Dsv5` family, 8 vCPU, >30 GiB RAM, premium-capable, on-demand. Hosts stateful middleware.
- `osdu` — same shape, taint `workload=osdu:NoSchedule`. Hosts OSDU services.

Both pin `AKSNodeClass.imageFamily: AzureLinux` with a 128 GiB OS disk. Disruption uses `WhenEmptyOrUnderutilized` with a 5-minute consolidation delay.

Rejected:

- **Declare NodePools in Bicep alongside the AKS cluster.** Bicep would have to either embed the CR as a `Microsoft.Resources/deployments` JSON blob (loses CR-level review) or call a `kubernetesClusterExtension`-style escape hatch. Either way the NodePool evolution is gated on a Bicep deploy when it should track workload evolution.
- **Apply NodePools imperatively from the CLI at bootstrap.** Re-opens the problem ADR-009 closed for everything else: cluster state stops being reconstructable from Git, and a NodePool tweak requires the CLI to run.
- **One shared NodePool.** Removes the workload-isolation guarantee. A platform middleware burst (PostgreSQL replica rebuild, ES JVM heap pressure) would compete with OSDU service scaling on the same nodes; the taints are how we keep those domains separate.

## Consequences

- NodePool changes flow through the same GitOps loop as every other workload manifest: PR, review, Flux reconcile. No CLI or Bicep redeploy.
- Workload isolation is enforced at the scheduler. Platform pods declare `tolerations` and `nodeSelector: agentpool=platform` in their charts; OSDU services declare the matching osdu pair. Mis-tolerated pods stay `Pending` rather than landing on the wrong pool.
- The Layer 0b position means NodePools are present before Layer 1 operators reconcile, so the first ECK or CNPG pod schedules on the correct pool without a Karpenter cold-start delay against unlabeled nodes.
- Adding a new workload domain (e.g., a future ingest pool) is a new NodePool + AKSNodeClass pair under `software/components/nodepools/` and a chart-level toleration. No infra-side change.
- The disruption settings (`WhenEmptyOrUnderutilized`, 5 min) are tuned for dev/test churn. Production-style workloads would likely want longer windows and `WhenEmpty` only; that is a future tuning concern, not a structural change.
