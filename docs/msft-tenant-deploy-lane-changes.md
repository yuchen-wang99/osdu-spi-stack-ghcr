# OSDU SPI — Changes Log: Dockerfile, MSFT‑Tenant Stack, Deploy Lane

Date: 2026-07-06

This document is a comprehensive record of the changes made across the OSDU SPI
work, organized into three parts as requested:

1. **Dockerfile analysis + fix** (App Insights agent / non‑root readability).
2. **SPI Stack changes to run in a Microsoft tenant** (`osdu-spi-stack`).
3. **Deploy‑lane changes** (`osdu-spi` template workflows/actions + service forks).

A fourth part captures **service source & test changes** that don't fit the three
buckets, and a fifth is a **"did we miss anything?" open‑items checklist**. A short
section up front records the **current dev5 / AG1 deployment and the path to MSFT**.

Each change lists **What / Where / Why / Fix / Tests** so the validation done for
every change is explicit.

# Current deployment: dev5 on the AzureGlobal1 (AG1) tenant → path to MSFT

**Where it runs today.** Everything in this document is currently deployed and being
validated on **dev5**, a live SPI Stack in the **AzureGlobal1 (AG1)** tenant:

| Fact | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Cluster / RG | `spi-stack-dev5` |
| Region | `eastus2` |
| Subscription | `4f9d8783…` (MCI‑ENERGY‑OSDU‑INTERNAL) |
| Tenant | `58975fd3…` (AzureGlobal1 / AG1, **non‑MSFT‑corp**) |
| Key Vault / ACR | `osdudev5b3637` / `osdudev5b3637.azurecr.io` |
| Gateway | `https://spi-stack-dev5-ingress.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com` |
| Flux namespace | `osdu-flux` |

**Why AG1 and not an MSFT‑corp tenant (the only tenant‑specific reason).** The deploy
lane authenticates to Azure with **GitHub Actions OIDC** (federated, secret‑less). The
MSFT‑corp tenant enforces a Conditional Access policy that rejects OIDC tokens lacking
a GitHub **Enterprise** claim, failing with **AADSTS7002381**. The `yuchen-osdu` dev
org is a **free‑plan** GitHub org, so its OIDC tokens don't carry that claim → blocked
in MSFT‑corp. The AG1 tenant does **not** enforce that policy, so OIDC from
`yuchen-osdu` works and we can iterate end‑to‑end there. This is a **GitHub‑org**
property, not a code problem.

**Everything else is tenant‑agnostic.** All the stack changes (Part 2) and deploy‑lane
changes (Part 3) — Base+NAP, Cosmos/Service Bus Workload Identity, Gremlin MSI,
per‑identity auth, the ADME‑equivalent acceptance suites, CI‑mode automation — are
**not** AG1‑specific. The AADSTS7002381 OIDC‑claim gate is the single remaining
tenant‑specific blocker.

**Path to MSFT (no blockers).** Once this code is **merged into the `Azure` GitHub
org** (a GitHub Enterprise org), OIDC tokens from that org carry the Enterprise claim
the MSFT‑corp tenant's Conditional Access requires. At that point the **same** deploy
lane can target an **MSFT‑corp tenant with no blockers** — the AKS‑Automatic guardrail,
Cosmos/Service Bus local‑auth, and Gremlin‑key blockers are already solved in code
(Part 2), so AG1 → MSFT is purely a matter of running from the enterprise org. **dev5 /
AG1 is the interim validation environment, not the target.**

# Repositories: visibility, merge status, and access

_Audited 2026‑07‑06._

| Repo | Visibility | Purpose | Our changes merged to `main`? | Daniel access |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `yuchen-osdu/osdu-spi` | Public | Template — canonical Dockerfile + workflows/actions | **Yes** — #25, #26, #16 (ADR‑038) | Public (view/clone) |
| `yuchen-osdu/osdu-spi-stack` | **Private** | Azure infra (Bicep) + `spi` CLI + Flux manifests | **Yes** — #2–#6 **and #7 (full MSFT‑tenant infra)** | **Collaborator invite sent (write, pending accept)** |
| `yuchen-osdu/partition` | Public | Service fork | **#16 open (reconsider)** — its Dockerfile `--chmod=0755` fix is already in the template (reaches the fork via the sync bot); its Istio `x-payload` tweak is an **internal‑testing artifact** (partition is internal/controlled in ADME), so #16 carries nothing that must merge. Blocked by the fork ruleset regardless. | Public (view/clone) |
| `yuchen-osdu/legal` | Public | Service fork | **#15 closed** (obsolete revert); ADME test‑suite re‑raised clean as **#19** (`fix/adme-legal-test-azure` — federated token + skip COO blob, no revert) | Public |
| `yuchen-osdu/storage` | Public | Service fork | **#13 closed** (obsolete revert); **no test‑code to re‑raise** — storage's test alignment is via repo vars (`MAVEN_GOAL`) + already‑upstream `AzureTestUtils`; deploy‑lane/docker are in the template | Public |
| `yuchen-osdu/entitlements` | Public | Service fork | Yes (`main`) | Public |
| `yuchen-wang99/osdu-spi-stack-aksauto` | Public (personal acct) | Flux GitOps mirror / deploy source | n/a | Public |

**MSFT‑tenant infra merge (2026‑07‑06).** `feature/gremlin-msi-bicep` (18 commits — Base+NAP, Cosmos/Service Bus `disableLocalAuth` + Workload Identity, Gremlin MSI, the four record‑ingestion blockers, real App Insights) was merged into `osdu-spi-stack` `main` via **PR #7**. Conflicts were resolved by keeping `main`'s namespace‑agnostic `reconcile`/`guard` (ADR‑014/032) and **renumbering the feature branch's ADRs to 021–024** (021 aks‑base, 022 disable‑local‑auth, 023 app‑insights, 024 record‑ingestion) to preserve the already‑merged 019 (ADME tests) / 020 (deploy‑lane invariants); all cross‑references updated. Validated: `ruff` clean, **65 `pytest`**, `bicep build` (aks/main/flux) OK.

**Sharing the private repo with Daniel.** `danielscholl` (GitHub User) was invited as a **write collaborator** to `osdu-spi-stack` — invite pending his acceptance. The five public repos need no grant. Note the fork PRs (partition #16, legal #15, storage #13) require a **second, non‑pusher approver**; once Daniel accepts he can provide that review.

# Part 1 — Dockerfile analysis and the App Insights agent fix

## 1.1 Where do the Dockerfiles come from?

- **Each service fork has its own `build/Dockerfile`** (`partition/build/Dockerfile`,
  `storage/build/Dockerfile`, `legal/build/Dockerfile`, …). There is not a single
  shared Dockerfile in `osdu-spi` that services import at build time.
- **But the `osdu-spi` template is canonical (ADR‑037).** The template holds the
  reference Dockerfile; forks inherit/refresh it through the SPI sync mechanism.
  So a fix made in the **template** propagates to **all** forks on sync — that is
  the "fix that benefits all."
- Practical consequence discovered the hard way: a fix applied only to
  `partition/build/Dockerfile` did **not** reach `storage`/`legal` (they still
  carried the old line), because the template — not partition — is the source of
  truth. See 1.2.

## 1.2 The App Insights agent readability bug (three‑stage evolution)

This was one root problem that surfaced three times as the fix was refined.

### Stage A — `dockerfile-agent` (crashloop, permissions)
- **What:** Services crash‑looped at startup.
- **Why:** The Dockerfile pulls the App Insights Java agent with
  `ADD <url> /opt/agents/applicationinsights-agent.jar`. `ADD` from a URL defaults
  the file to **mode 0600, root‑owned**. Services run as **non‑root UID 1000**, so
  the process cannot read the jar → JVM `-javaagent` fails → crashloop.
- **Fix (first attempt):** add `--chmod=0644` to the `ADD`. *(partition, PR #16)*

### Stage B — `npe-500` (the real integration‑test blocker)
- **What:** After `--chmod=0644`, partition returned **HTTP 500** through the
  gateway (`LogCustomDimensionFilter` NPE), which was the actual acceptance‑test
  blocker.
- **Why (root cause):** `ADD --chmod=0644` also set the auto‑created **`/opt/agents`
  directory** to `0644` — **no execute/traverse bit**. UID 1000 cannot traverse the
  dir → entrypoint `[ -f .../agent.jar ]` is false → `-javaagent` is never attached
  → App Insights request‑telemetry context is null → `core-lib-azure`
  `LogCustomDimensionFilter` dereferences it with no null‑guard → NPE → 500.
- **Fix:** use **`--chmod=0755`** (directory traversable *and* jar readable).
- **Where:** `core-lib-azure` `LogCustomDimensionFilter:26` is the NPE site; the
  Dockerfile `ADD` is the real cause.

### Stage C — `storage-agent-chmod` (propagation gap)
- **What:** The SPI‑built **storage** image (`…/storage:a786732`) crash‑looped at
  JVM init: *"Error opening zip file or JAR manifest missing
  /opt/agents/applicationinsights-agent.jar."*
- **Why:** Partition had the `--chmod=0755` fix **locally**, but it was **never
  propagated to the template or the other forks**. Storage/legal still shipped the
  old `ADD`. Same class of non‑propagation as the deploy‑lane digest fix (Part 3).
- **Fix (the one that benefits all):** add `--chmod=0755` to the agent `ADD` in the
  **`osdu-spi` template** and in the **storage** and **legal** forks (partition
  already had it). Template is canonical, so future forks inherit it automatically.

### Tests / validation (Part 1)
- **Partition (Stage B):** after `--chmod=0755` — App Insights agent attached
  (`/opt/agents` 0755), the NPE disappeared, and **ListPartitions + HealthCheck +
  Swagger passed through the gateway**. A prior session (`ae6b083b`) had already
  proven that attaching the agent removes the NPE.
- **Storage (Stage C):** after the template/fork fix, the storage image starts
  cleanly (no zip/JAR‑manifest crash) and went on to run the full storage
  acceptance suite (see Part 3 E2E: 126/133).
- **Related root‑cause confirmation:** the App Insights NPE was independently
  reproduced and explained in the stack work (Part 2.7) — `core-lib-azure ≥ 2.5.6`
  ships `LogCustomDimensionFilter` with no null guard.

# Part 2 — SPI Stack changes to run in a Microsoft tenant

Making `osdu-spi-stack` deploy and run under Microsoft‑tenant Azure policy required
changes across five areas: **AKS platform**, **Cosmos/Service Bus local‑auth**,
**Gremlin MSI**, **per‑identity auth**, and a set of **deploy‑blocker fixes**.
Branch for stack infra work: `feature/gremlin-msi-bicep` (Flux source =
public mirror `yuchen-wang99/osdu-spi-stack-aksauto`).

## 2.1 AKS Automatic guardrails → pivot to Base SKU + NAP

- **What:** After an Azure‑side hardening wave (~2026‑06‑02), AKS **Automatic**
  clusters made **managed system node pools mandatory**, which enforces admission
  guardrails that broke the stack in four ways:
  1. **AKS create** rejected `userAssignedNATGateway` + managed hosted pool.
  2. Deployer **writes to protected `flux-system`** denied.
  3. Flux **`flux-applier` impersonation** denied (`multiTenancy.enforce=true`).
  4. **`MutatingWebhookConfiguration` create/modify blocked for ALL identities**
     (even cluster‑admin) — non‑bypassable. cert‑manager + CloudNativePG both
     *require* MWCs, so the full stack **cannot reconcile on AKS Automatic**
     post‑2026‑06‑02.
- **Proof (not assumed):** Daniel's same commit `6470bd5b` passed 2026‑06‑01 and
  failed 2026‑06‑02 (Azure regression, not code). Even
  `yuchenwang@microsoft.com` (cluster‑admin) got
  *"Creation or modification of MutatingWebhookConfiguration resources is not
  allowed."*
- **Fix:**
  - Pivot the cluster from **AKS Automatic → AKS Base SKU + Node Auto‑Provisioning
    (NAP)**, where the MWC guardrail does not apply. `infra/aks.bicep` rewritten as
    a **raw `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters@2026-03-01`** with
    `hostedSystemProfile` (nodeSubnetID + systemNodeSubnetID); `infra/modules/vnet.bicep`
    adds a managed system node subnet.
  - `infra/flux.bicep`: `multiTenancy.enforce=false` (removes `flux-applier`
    impersonation).
  - All CLI/GitOps‑written config moved from protected `flux-system` → user
    namespace **`osdu-flux`** (touches `secrets.py`, `images.py`, `deploy.py`,
    `bootstrap.py`, `guard.py`, `ingress.py`, `templates.py`, `status.py`,
    `info.py`, `cli.py`, and `software/**`).
- **Note:** On the non‑corp tenant used for dev5 (Base+NAP), the MWC guardrail is
  gone — cert‑manager/CNPG/eck/trust‑manager all reconcile `Ready`.

## 2.2 Cosmos + Service Bus local‑auth disabled → Workload Identity

- **What:** MSFT‑tenant policy denies creating Cosmos/Service Bus with **local
  (key) auth enabled** (`… Denied When Local Auth Is Enabled`).
- **Fix (Bicep + manifests):**
  - Cosmos Gremlin: `disableLocalAuth: true`; stop writing a real
    `graph-db-primary-key`; assign **built‑in Gremlin Data Contributor** to the
    OSDU identity.
  - Service Bus namespace: `disableLocalAuth: true`, `minimumTlsVersion: '1.2'`;
    `{partition}-sb-connection` secret set to `DISABLED`; RBAC = **Azure Service Bus
    Data Owner**; Service‑Bus‑consuming service manifests set
    `AZURE_MSI_ISENABLED=true` (so `core-lib` picks the Workload‑Identity token
    path, not keys).
- **Dependency caught:** `indexer-queue` master pins `core-lib-azure 2.0.6`, whose
  Service Bus path is **not** Workload‑Identity‑aware → the hard blocker for SB
  MSI. (Fixed in the service via MR !474, Part 4.)

## 2.3 Gremlin MSI entitlements (custom image, ADR‑020)

- **What:** The community entitlements image reads `graph-db-primary-key`, which no
  longer exists once Cosmos local‑auth is disabled.
- **Fix:** deploy the **MSI‑Gremlin entitlements image**
  (`…/entitlements:gremlin-msi-direct-…`) — obtains a Cosmos token
  (`https://cosmos.azure.com/.default`) via Workload Identity and uses it as the
  Gremlin password. Swapped in by patching the `osdu-image-lock` ConfigMap
  (ns `osdu-flux`) **before** the `osdu-services` Kustomization renders.
- Proven end‑to‑end in prior sessions (WI token → MSI Gremlin connect →
  tenant‑provisioning 200).

## 2.4 Per‑identity auth model (Lua + entitlements seeding)

Two coupled changes so the **CI Managed Identity** can authenticate as a real,
entitled user (needed for integration tests through the mesh).

- **`lua-identity` (ADR‑016):** The Istio `EnvoyFilter` Lua mapped **all**
  `aud=management.azure.com` tokens to the single service‑account `entraClientId`,
  which bypasses entitlements. **Fix:** in the management branch, map by the token's
  **`payload[appid]`** (the real caller) instead of the service account. Bootstrap
  is unaffected (UAMI `appid == entraClientId`). *Committed in `templates.py`;
  source‑complete.*
- **`onboard-seed`:** The CI MSI `appid` was never granted entitlements membership.
  **Fix:** `spi onboard` gained `_ensure_entitlements_membership` (+ `--partition`
  flag) — runs a short in‑cluster Job as the tenant‑provisioning OWNER
  (`workload-identity-sa`) that POSTs the CI MSI `appid` into the four ADME groups
  (`users`, `users.datalake.ops`, `users.datalake.admins`, `users.data.root`) via
  the AddMember API; idempotent (409 = ok), dry‑run aware, self‑verifying. Mirrors
  ADME `InstanceInit.cs`.

## 2.5 `onboard` custom deploy‑role fix (`onboard-rbac`)

- **What:** The onboard‑created custom Azure role carried **invalid k8s
  `dataActions`** (`…/pods/log/read`, a Flux CRD action) that are not registered
  `Microsoft.ContainerService` operations, so `az role definition create` failed —
  and it was called with `check=False`, so it **failed silently** and blocked the
  deploy at the CI‑mode Flux‑suspend step.
- **Fix (codified, commit `6699117`, branch `feat/per-identity-entitlements`):**
  drop both invalid `dataActions`; set `check=True` (fail loud); add
  `_ensure_flux_read_rbac` — a **native k8s Role + RoleBinding** (subject =
  principalId) that grants the Flux read needed by the CI‑mode suspend pre‑check.

## 2.6 The four deploy‑blocker fixes (dev2, commit `8e73cd7`)

Found because prior sessions only ever exercised entitlements + indexer‑queue;
storage/legal/schema/search/workflow were never tested. All root‑caused, fixed
live, and codified:

1. **Cosmos SQL data‑plane RBAC:** per‑partition Cosmos SQL + `osdu-system-db`
   disable local auth but never granted the OSDU UAMI a data role → **403** on
   legal/storage/schema/workflow. Fix: `principalId` param + **Built‑in Data
   Contributor (`…0002`)** `sqlRoleAssignment` (`partition.bicep` + `main.bicep`).
2. **`system-cosmos-*` KV secrets missing:** schema/workflow ('system' services)
   need `system-cosmos-endpoint/-primary-key/-connection`. Fix: write the three
   secrets in the primary partition module, guarded on `isPrimaryPartition`.
3. **Storage record container missing:** storage‑azure writes record blobs to a
   container named after the partition id (`opendes`); `core-lib` BlobStore does not
   auto‑create → **404 ContainerNotFound**. Fix: `union(partitionStorageContainerNames,
   [partition])`.
4. **Elasticsearch TLS:** ECK serves HTTPS self‑signed (CA in truststore), but the
   partition record said `elastic-ssl-enabled=false` (→ plaintext ConnectionClosed)
   and used a `…svc.cluster.local` endpoint absent from the cert SANs
   (→ SSLPeerUnverifiedException). Fix: `elastic-ssl-enabled=true` +
   endpoint `elasticsearch-es-http.platform.svc` (`deploy.py` + `templates.py`).

## 2.7 App Insights NPE (real telemetry) — stack side

- **What:** `core-lib-azure ≥ 2.5.6` ships `LogCustomDimensionFilter`, which reads
  the AI request‑telemetry context on every request **with no null guard** → NPE →
  500 when App Insights is not initialized. AKS Automatic enabled AI by default;
  Base did not.
- **Fix:** provision **real App Insights** (`main.bicep`) + wire the connection
  string into `osdu-config` (`envFrom`, all services) with a dummy fallback;
  per‑service `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_ROLE_NAME`. Removed the earlier
  entitlements‑specific dummy‑key hack. *(commits `6b3c2ff`, `94c7cb0`)*
- This is the stack‑side counterpart to the Dockerfile fix in Part 1 (both must be
  right for the agent to actually attach and the filter to have context).

## 2.8 Region / zone fix (`aks-zones`)

- **What:** eastus2 systempool rejects availability zone `2` (only `1,3`
  supported); canadacentral hit a Cosmos zonal‑redundant capacity shortage.
- **Fix:** `infra/aks.bicep` availability zones `['1','2','3']` → `['1','3']`;
  Cosmos already `isZoneRedundant:false`. **Open:** this edit is still a local
  uncommitted change on the feature branch — see Part 5.

### Tests / validation (Part 2)
- **dev1 (canadacentral, Base+NAP):** full stack reconciled — platform 14/14,
  foundation 6/6, ingress 3/3; both custom images Running+Ready; real App Insights
  telemetry flowing; external gateway 200.
- **dev2 (canadacentral) from‑scratch E2E:** **13/13 OSDU API smoke green**,
  including the full `storage → indexer-queue → indexer → search` data flow
  (`search totalCount=2`); all 9 services `/info` = 200 externally. This run
  surfaced + validated the four blocker fixes (2.6).
- **dev3 (canadacentral) from‑scratch:** **13/13 green**; proved all four codified
  blocker fixes land automatically on a clean deploy (verified on the PaaS layer
  before Flux reconciled: system‑cosmos secrets, opendes blob container, Cosmos SQL
  data role, App Insights, elastic endpoint).
- **dev5 (eastus2) new‑tenant deploy:** `spi up` completed exit 0 on the non‑corp
  tenant; infra + PaaS + Flux up; gateway live; entitlements custom image swapped.
- **Unit/build gates (every stack commit):** `bicep build`, `ruff`, `helm
  template/lint`, and **54 `pytest`** all green; onboard/CLI pytest green for the
  onboard changes (2.4/2.5); what‑if clean.

# Part 3 — Deploy lane (CI/CD)

The engineering system Daniel built (the three‑branch fork model) produces validated
Maven artifacts, but it stops there — no container image, no deployment, and no
integration‑test signal against a live cluster. **Part 3 is the deploy lane we added
on top of it**: a reusable pipeline that takes a merged change on a service fork,
builds and pushes a container image, deploys it to the shared `osdu-spi-stack`
cluster, and runs that service's ADME acceptance suite against the live gateway.

Design principles it's built on:

- **Reusable template workflow (ADR‑015).** The whole lane is authored once in the
  `osdu-spi` template (`.github/template-workflows/validate.yml` plus composite
  actions under `.github/actions/`) and synced to every fork. Per‑service specifics
  come from GitHub **repo variables** (`SERVICE_NAME`, `AKS_CLUSTER_NAME`,
  `K8S_NAMESPACE`, `K8S_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`, `K8S_CONTAINER_NAME`, `FLUX_NAMESPACE`,
  `GATEWAY_URL`, `KEYVAULT_NAME`, `AAD_CLIENT_ID`), so no fork edits the workflow.
- **Immutable digests (ADR‑032).** Every deploy references the image by `sha256:`
  digest, never a mutable tag, so the running image is provably the one the build
  produced and the tests exercised.
- **CI mode (ADR‑032).** The lane deploys imperatively into a Flux‑suspended cluster
  (§3.6), so GitOps never reverts a CI image mid‑test.
- **Secret‑less, per‑identity auth.** Every Azure step logs in with a federated
  **OIDC** token (`id-token: write`), and the tests authenticate as the CI Managed
  Identity — there is no service‑principal client secret anywhere in the lane.

## 3.1 Pipeline shape (`validate.yml`)

On a qualifying event the workflow runs a job graph:

```
check-init → check-repo-state → check-paths → java-build
          → docker-build → docker-push → deploy → integration-test
                                       (+ code-quality, cluster-health)
```

`deploy` and `integration-test` run only for same‑repo pushes — a PR from a fork
can't reach the cluster. A **per‑service concurrency group**
(`spi-stack-${SERVICE_NAME}`) serializes a service against itself while still letting
different services deploy in parallel.

## 3.2 Build and push

`java-build → docker-build → docker-push` compile the service, build the container
(multi‑arch), and push it to the registry. `docker-push` outputs the **image digest**,
which is the only image reference used from here on.

## 3.3 Deploy — the `aks-deploy` action

Given the cluster/namespace/deployment repo‑vars and the pushed digest, `aks-deploy`
runs these steps:

1. **OIDC login** to Azure (federated, secret‑less) and fetch AKS credentials.
2. **Validate the digest format.**
3. **CI‑mode pre‑flight assertion** — verify Flux is suspended (GitRepository,
   Kustomizations, *and* HelmReleases) and **fail loud** if anything is reconciling,
   pointing at `spi reconcile --suspend`. This is the guard that stops GitOps from
   racing the deploy (§3.6).
4. **Capture the previous digest**, so a bad deploy can be restored.
5. **`kubectl set image deployment/<name> <container>=<repo>@<digest>`** — the deploy
   itself: one imperative call, by digest.
6. **Wait for rollout**, then **capture the deployed digest** from the new
   **Running, non‑terminating, Ready** pod — deliberately not `.items[0]`, so a
   draining old pod can never be recorded as the new one. That digest is handed to
   the test job.

## 3.4 Integration test — the `integration-test` action

The test job re‑authenticates (OIDC), fetches AKS credentials, and then:

1. **Digest guard** — confirm the pod that will serve the tests is *still* running the
   exact digest `aks-deploy` recorded; if the cluster drifted (e.g. an overlapping
   run), it stops rather than testing the wrong image.
2. **Cross‑service health probe** (advisory) against the services this one depends on.
3. **Mint the acceptance‑test token with no secret** — a federated
   `INTEGRATION_TESTER_ACCESS_TOKEN` for the CI Managed Identity — and inject the
   non‑secret config from `env_map` (service URLs, `INTEGRATION_TESTER`, `AZURE_AD_*`).
4. **Load Key Vault secrets** named by `secret_map`, masked and multiline‑safe.
5. **Run the ADME `<svc>-test-azure` suite** through the gateway (`maven_goal`), with
   **retry** (`max_attempts`) and a tunable per‑attempt **timeout** (`timeout_minutes`)
   sized for the reactor build plus the live tests.
6. **Publish JUnit results** and a run summary.

The per‑service inputs it consumes — `test_dir`, `maven_goal`, `root_token_env`,
`env_map`, `secret_map`, `gateway_url`, `keyvault_name`, `aad_client_id` — are the
onboarding variables covered in §3.7.

Two robustness details were load‑bearing for getting stable green runs: the
`maven_goal` carries `-Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false` so a
`-pl <svc>-test-azure -am` reactor build doesn't fail when a `-Dtest=!…` exclusion
leaves the *core* module with zero matching tests; and the digest guard together with
the per‑service concurrency group (§3.1) keep two overlapping runs from testing each
other's images.

## 3.5 Running the suites ADME‑equivalent and secret‑less

The suites are the real ADME `testing/<svc>-test-azure` modules, made to run
secret‑less on the per‑identity token:

- **Legal** — adopted ADME's `AzureLegalTagUtils` (its `accessToken()` prefers the
  pre‑minted `INTEGRATION_TESTER_ACCESS_TOKEN`), and — following ADME's `OSDU-Legal`
  m26 — left the COO‑blob `uploadTenantTestingConfigFile()` calls commented out (the
  deployed service already carries that config). That removed the last test needing a
  storage‑account key, so the **service principal + secret we had created was deleted**
  — the legal suite is now byte‑identical to ADME and fully secret‑less.
- **Storage** — ADME's `AzureTestUtils` already accepts the pre‑minted token, so no
  code change was needed.
- **Key Vault parity** — the only KV‑sourced values (`dataStorageAccount/Key`,
  `serviceBusConnectionString`) are a *delivery* difference, not an extra requirement:
  ADME injects the same values at runtime from its leased instance's Key Vault, and we
  map them identically via `secret_map` from the stack Key Vault.

## 3.6 CI‑mode automation (setter + checker)

CI mode — the Flux‑suspended steady state the lane deploys into (ADR‑032) — used to be
a manual `flux suspend` step, and the CLI only suspended Kustomizations, which wasn't
enough: the services are **HelmRelease‑managed**, so a HelmRelease reconcile would
still revert a `kubectl set image`. Two merged changes closed that gap:

- **Setter — `osdu-spi-stack #6`:** `spi reconcile --suspend` now performs a full
  freeze (**GitRepository + all Kustomizations + all HelmReleases**; `--resume`
  reverses), with the Flux namespace auto‑resolved from the live GitRepository (fixing
  a hardcoded `flux-system` that broke on the `osdu-flux` stack).
- **Checker — `osdu-spi #26`:** the `aks-deploy` pre‑flight (§3.3, step 3) asserts all
  of it is suspended and fails loud otherwise.

Net: entering CI mode is a single `spi reconcile --suspend`, and the deploy lane
refuses to run unless the cluster is in it.

## 3.7 Per‑service onboarding variables (ONBOARD‑INIT) — design only

The per‑service acceptance‑test inputs in §3.4 (`test_dir`, `maven_goal`,
`root_token_env`, `env_map`, `secret_map`, …) are today **hand‑set per fork**.
Research (no implementation) produced a recommended way to automate them:

- The variables split into **three tiers**: (1) universal auth (identical for every
  service), (2) derivable from stack facts + service name (service URLs, partition,
  domain, Key Vault), and (3) irreducibly service‑specific (test exclusions,
  cross‑service dependencies, feature tokens, module‑name exceptions).
- **Recommendation:** auto‑derive tiers 1 and 2 (the lane already mints the token and
  `spi onboard` already writes the stack facts), and supply tier 3 from a small
  per‑service **IT profile** translated once from that service's ADME
  `ServiceITsProd.yml` block, checked into the `osdu-spi` template and read by
  `setup-service-variables.sh`. Parsing ADME's pipeline at runtime was rejected
  (cross‑org coupling).
- Only **four profiles are needed now** (legal, storage, partition, entitlements — the
  forked services). Captured in the separate ONBOARD‑INIT research notes.
- **Blocked:** ONBOARD‑INIT‑B (#11) depends on ONBOARD‑INIT‑A (input‑mechanism spec)
  upstream.

### Validation — end‑to‑end results

- **Storage acceptance (dev5, per‑identity federated token + seeded MSI):**
  **133 run, 126 pass, 0 error, 1 skip, 7 fail.** All 7 failures are
  `PostFetchRecordsIntegrationTests.should_returnRecordsAfterCrsConversion__*` —
  **crs‑conversion is not deployed** in any namespace (out of scope for
  partition/entitlements/legal/storage); its route `/api/crs/converter/v3` 500s. Those
  7 methods are excluded ADME‑style; the **per‑identity auth model is validated by the
  126 passing tests.**
- **Legal acceptance (dev5):** green and **fully secret‑less** (federated CI‑MSI
  token); the COO‑blob test removed to match ADME (§3.5). `INTEGRATION_TESTER` is set
  to the legal CI MSI.
- **Partition acceptance (deploy‑lane E2E):** validate run `28210313734` (re‑run) →
  **Tests run: 11, Failures: 0** (`GetPartitionByIdApiTest` 4/4). An earlier 404 chain
  was root‑caused (workflow HelmRelease InProgress → osdu‑services health gate →
  bootstrap never ran → `opendes` record absent) and fixed by pinning workflow to a
  dev3 known‑good image (see Part 4).
- **CI‑mode automation:** `tests/test_reconcile.py` (5 tests) pass; the setter was
  live‑validated on dev5 (0/0 not‑suspended); the checker is merged.
- **Template/fork wiring:** the deploy/test actions, timeout/surefire settings, and
  the token standardization all live in the canonical template, so every fork inherits
  them on sync.

# Part 4 — Service source & test changes (outside the three buckets)

These are real code changes in the **service forks** that were needed to get the
deploy lane green but don't belong to Dockerfile / stack / lane.

## 4.1 Interim upstream‑regression workarounds (netty 4.1/4.2)

> **Framing — these were temporary measures to unblock testing, not permanent
> reverts.** At the time, the upstream community `*-master` service images had a
> genuine netty/lettuce regression that broke the services, so reverting/pinning to a
> known‑good baseline was the fastest way to keep the deploy lane moving. **Most of
> these upstream issues have since been fixed** (the related upstream packages were
> repaired and merged), so these interim reverts/pins can be dropped as the fixes
> propagate — they are not intended to live in the forks long‑term.
>
> **Update 2026‑07‑06:** the `legal #15` / `storage #13` revert PRs were **closed
> (abandoned)** as obsolete — upstream is fixed, so the forks pick up the corrected
> packages via the "⬆️ Sync with upstream" bot PR. Their branches are preserved for
> salvaging the small ADME test‑suite pieces (to be re‑done cleanly on `main`).

- **`legal-netty` / `workflow-netty`:** upstream community `*-master` images built
  ~2026‑06‑25 mix **netty 4.2.14 (common) vs 4.1.118 (buffer)** →
  `NoClassDefFoundError: io.netty.channel.MultiThreadIoEventLoopGroup` (from
  `lettuce-core 7.5.2`, the Redis client) → crash/500 on the entitlements‑cache
  lookup.
- **Interim workaround (legal/storage forks):** temporarily **revert** the "Migrate to os‑core‑common 7.1.0"
  MR (legal `5cc42bc`, parent `73355cb8`; storage `616525e7`, parent `5db25e7adf0b`).
  That MR bumped `os-core-common 6.0.0 → 7.1.0`, forcing `lettuce-core 7.5.2` (CVE)
  which needs netty 4.2, but runtime had netty 4.1. After revert: `os-core-common
  6.0.0`, `lettuce 6.8.1`, `netty 4.1.130` consistent; legal‑azure builds clean +
  dep‑tree verified. Whole‑commit revert (poms + tests together, since tests were
  migrated for the 7.1.0 API).
- **`dev5-pin-stability`:** pinned the non‑target dev5 services (file, indexer,
  schema, search) to **dev3 known‑good tags**; workflow pinned to `e4ae2ad4b7af`
  (Jun 17, pre‑regression). All Running 2/2, HR `UpgradeSucceeded`.

## 4.2 Storage no‑data‑access test skip (`storage-nodata-skip`)
- Only `TestRecordAccessAuthorization` uses `getNoDataAccessToken()`; it needs a
  **second identity** (`NO_DATA_ACCESS_TESTER`). Interim: `ENV_MAP
  NO_DATA_ACCESS_TESTER=<dummy>` + `MAVEN_GOAL -Dtest=!TestRecordAccessAuthorization`.
  **Open:** provisioning the real second identity is deferred (Part 5).

## 4.3 indexer‑queue Workload‑Identity core‑lib bump (MR !474)
- **What:** `indexer-queue-azure-enqueue` pins `core-lib-azure 2.0.6`, whose Service
  Bus subscription client can't use the Workload‑Identity token path. With SB local
  auth disabled (MSFT‑tenant policy) the queue consumer never subscribes to
  `recordstopic` → records aren't indexed.
- **Fix:** bump `core-lib-azure 2.0.6 → 2.5.10` (Workload‑Identity‑aware SB
  credential). MR **!474** on `feature/servicebus-workload-identity`. **Merged** —
  Jordan fixed the related upstream packages and merged the MR.

# Part 5 — Did we miss anything? Open items & status

| Item | Status | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aks-zones` eastus2 `['1','3']` | **codify** | `feature/gremlin-msi-bicep` is now merged to `main`, but `main`'s `infra/aks.bicep` still carries the default `['1','2','3']`; the eastus2 `['1','3']` tweak was **never committed**. Codify region‑aware (don't hardcode `['1','3']`). |
| Storage `NO_DATA_ACCESS_TESTER` 2nd identity | **open** | Currently a dummy + test exclusion; real second identity deferred (user: "fix later"). |
| ONBOARD‑INIT automation (per‑service vars) | **open / blocked** | Design done (3.6); implementation blocked on ONBOARD‑INIT‑A upstream. 4 profiles needed now. |
| partition #16 | **open (reconsider)** | Dockerfile chmod (already in the template) + an Istio `x-payload` decode tweak that is an **internal‑testing artifact** — partition is internal/controlled in ADME and is the only deployed service using that filter, so the path is only hit by our external‑token test exposure. Can be closed, or the filter disabled to match the other services. Blocked by the fork ruleset regardless. |
| legal #15 / storage #13 (os‑core‑common reverts) | **closed (abandoned)** | Obsolete — upstream netty/lettuce fixed; forks pick it up via the "⬆️ Sync with upstream" bot PR. Branches `fix/revert-os-core-common-7.1.0` preserved to salvage the small ADME test‑suite bits (do it cleanly on current `main`, no revert). |
| indexer‑queue MR !474 | **merged** | `core-lib-azure` WI bump; Jordan fixed the related upstream packages and merged it. |
| `lua-identity` live validation | **partial** | Source‑complete + committed; not validated on dev5 (partition is internal — needs a user‑facing service to exercise the per‑identity path). |
| `helmrelease-suspend-gap` | **resolved** | Closed by `spi reconcile --suspend` full freeze (3.5). |

**Merge state (`merge-state`, updated 2026‑07‑06):**
- **Merged to `main`:** `osdu-spi-stack` **#2–#6** (onboard, per‑identity ADR‑016/019/020, CI‑mode reconcile) **and #7** (full MSFT‑tenant infra — Base+NAP, Cosmos/SB WI, Gremlin MSI, blockers, App Insights; feature ADRs renumbered 021–024); `osdu-spi` **#25** (template: chmod, digest‑capture, token std, concurrency), **#26** (aks‑deploy suspend assertion), **#16** (ADR‑038, defer extra‑file Docker support).
- **Open (reconsider):** `partition #16` — Dockerfile chmod (already in the template) + an Istio `x-payload` tweak that turned out to be an **internal‑testing artifact** (partition is internal/controlled in ADME; only our external‑token test exposure hit it). Nothing here must merge; can be closed. Blocked by the fork ruleset regardless.
- **Closed (abandoned) 2026‑07‑06, test work re‑raised clean:** `legal #15`, `storage #13` — the os‑core‑common 7.1.0 reverts are obsolete (upstream fixed; forks get it via the "⬆️ Sync with upstream" bot PR). The **non‑revert test‑suite work was split out onto fresh branches off `main`**: legal → **PR #19** (`fix/adme-legal-test-azure`: federated `INTEGRATION_TESTER_ACCESS_TOKEN` + skip COO‑blob upload, cherry‑picked, no revert); storage had **no test‑code** to re‑raise (its alignment is via repo variables + already‑upstream `AzureTestUtils`; the deploy‑lane/docker commits are already canonical in the template). Original revert branches preserved.
- All other open PRs in the forks are **bots** (dependabot deps bumps, the `yuchen-osdu-spi-bot` template/upstream sync + release), not our changes.

**Tracking issues updated (`github-issues-updated`):** status comments posted on
`yuchen-osdu/osdu-spi` **#1** (epic), **#13** (STACK‑OPS), **#11** (ONBOARD‑INIT‑B).

**Things intentionally out of scope:** crs‑conversion (not deployed),
`osdu-spi-stack #1` (MSFT‑corp tenant), search/notification/register/dataset/etc.
forks (not yet created).
